## Usage Examples

### Using Platform Optimizations
```tsx
import { usePlatformOptimizations } from '../hooks/usePlatformOptimizations';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    isIOS, 
    isAndroid, 
    isWeb, 
    getAnimationConfig, 
    canUseBlurEffects,
    optimizedStyles 
  } = usePlatformOptimizations();

  return (
    <View style={optimizedStyles.card}>
      {/* Platform-specific content */}
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Using Mobile Optimizations
```tsx
import { useMobileOptimizations } from '../hooks/useMobileOptimizations';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    getOptimizedImageSize, 
    getAnimationConfig, 
    trackPerformance 
  } = useMobileOptimizations();

  const optimizedSize = getOptimizedImageSize(300, 200);
  
  return <Image source={{ uri: '...' }} style={optimizedSize} />;
};
```

### Using Permissions
```tsx
import { useCameraPermission } from '../hooks/usePermissions';

const CameraComponent = () => {
  const { 
    permission, 
    requestPermission, 
    hasPermission 
  } = useCameraPermission();

  if (!hasPermission) {
    return <PermissionRequest onRequest={requestPermission} />;
  }

  return <Camera />;
};
```
